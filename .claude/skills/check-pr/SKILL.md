description: When you submit a PR (or push a change to a branch that already has a PR), wait for CI checks to perform, and process them.
---

Check regularly if all Github actions have run. If they have, and they failed, please check why, and implementany fix. Before pushing, make sure you are not introducing more changes than required.

Make sure to _also_ check for reviewer comments and analyze them. When changes are required by reviewers, please implement them. There again, it is important to only change what's needed.

Importantly, please post a summary of your changes so that agents can also keep track of changes that you performed.
